title: About me
---

My name is William Minozzi. I'm an associate professor of political science at The Ohio State University. I'm interested in a wide variety of topics in political science and economics, including campaigns, elections, legislative politics, political communication, international relations, formal theory, incentivized experiments, causal inference, and probably some other things too.
