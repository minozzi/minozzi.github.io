This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also [**available for consulting**](/shiny), so feel free to [contact me](/contact) if it looks like we could work together.

## Website templates (Jekyll)

-  **[Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)** - a popular Jekyll theme I created when making this website.  You can [view a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) or use it yourself to make a pretty website similar to this one by visiting the [project page](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme). The theme is extremely easy to install - you can have a site up and running in 2 minutes, and it is designed to look great on both mobile devices and laptops.
